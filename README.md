# homework-three
Okay, this is my last week of playing catch up from Hurricane Ida. First, I have to say that my tutor, Ben, and my TA, Login (logdog) were so helpful in my completion of the password generator. 

I understand how to effectively use more complicated variables now, while loops, and if statements. Function generators and query selectors I have a tenative grasp on and will go back and review these elements of Javascript on Thursday and Friday. Though I did understand how they worked in this exercise, I think further use of them in my coding will help me be able to use the more easily.

At this point, I am beginning to become more comfortable with basic javascript and look forward for the next couple of days to master these basics even more by review the coursework, reviewing our bootcamp videos, reading Javascript books, watching Java Youtube videos.
